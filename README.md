# ML_Pipeline_Notebooks
This repository is dedicated to providing example jupyter notebooks primarily for educational purposes. 

The single juptyer notebook currently included in this repository was designed to be paired with an introductary lecture on Machine learning at the University of Pennsylvania on 5/1/19. 

It offers an example pipeline for analyzing a biomedical dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Benchmark Archive, discussing and providing examples of all essential elements of a machine learning pipeline.
